Group Project  
Contribution:data cleanning with tidyverse & data virtualization with R shiny  

This is a project related with nature disaster, based on real-world dataset. Our group built two models to analysis the probability of natural disasters. I contributed to:  

1. data cleaning: using tidyverse to organize the raw data and merge several datasets. Making data easily to analysis.   
2. data virtualization: in this part, I used R shiny to build a worldmap showing the distribution of earthquake, a wordcloud showing the frequency of earthquake, a hazard map showing magnitude distribution.
